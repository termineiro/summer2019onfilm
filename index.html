    <h3>    This past summer, I took a vintage camera, went on adventures, & captured some of it on film. I started out with an analog camera that I found in a thrift store. I saw it and fell in love. I immediately went home and found some ISO 800 & 400 film and loaded the thing. The heavy, silver and black camera took a backseat the second half of the summer when I decided to buy disposable cameras. The rest, is history & captured on this page as a lovely portfolio. From me, to you. Enjoy.
